# v2.4.0

## Highlights

- **Play Integrity bypass** without breaking device checks or causing other issues
- Disabled use of hardware attestation on Pixel 7 and newer (@anirudhgupta109)

## Other changes

- Updated instructions for newer Android and Magisk versions
- Better debugging for future development

**This version only supports Zygisk (Magisk 24 and newer).**

It's taken a while to find way to bypass Play Integrity that doesn't require spoofing the build fingerprint permanently, but I wanted to make sure this module doesn't cause any unnecessary breakage. Enjoy!
