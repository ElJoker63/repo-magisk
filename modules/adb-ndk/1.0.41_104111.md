### Description
Marshmallow removed adb from the /system/bin/ directory. For those wanting this functionality back, here's an installer to push static compiles of adb and fastboot to /system/xbin/, with a wrapper to point adb to the correct HOME directory and set TMPDIR for compatibility. Detects and supports SuperSU/Magisk systemless installs. Can then be used from Terminal while booted.
