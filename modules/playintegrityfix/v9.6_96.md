# v9.6

- FIX DETECTION ISSUES IN FEW APPS (Dobby cause this, so Shadowhook is used again).
- Removed libcxx and use system STL.
- Removed LTO.
- Due Dobby problems and using Shadowhook, x86 and x86_64 libs removed :(
- Added props from original kdrag0n safetynet-fix.

If some apps (like games or banks) doesn't work try to use HuskyDG sensitive_props module.
This module has global spoof of ro.product.first_api_level so be aware of possible bugs if your device has been released with Android 13+

Also you can use Magisk Alpha (vvb2060 project) + private Shamiko build from "secret" chinese Telegram group.
